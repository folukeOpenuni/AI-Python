Millions of people have been infected, and millions of deaths have been reported worldwide. Glucocorticoids have attracted worldwide attention for their potential efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. Various glucocorticoids with different dosages and treatment durations have been studied in patients with different severities, with a suitable dosage and treatment duration not yet defined. This study aimed to investigate whether in-hospital survival differs between critically ill patients treated with low-dose glucocorticoids, high-dose glucocorticoids or no glucocorticoids. All critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the Charite Hospital-Universitatsmedizin Berlin between February 2020 and December 2021 with COVID-19 pneumonia receiving supplemental oxygen were eligible to participate in this multicenter real-world data study. Patients were retrospectively assigned to one of three groups: the high corticosteroid dose (HighC) group (receiving 6 mg parenteral dexamethasone or an equivalent corticosteroid dosage for ten days), the low corticosteroid dose (LowC) group (receiving less than 6 mg parenteral dexamethasone or an equivalent corticosteroid dosage for ten days), or the no corticosteroid (NoC) group. Overall survival and risk effects were compared among groups within the total observation period, as well as at 35 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Adjusted multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to compare the risk of death between the treatment groups. Out of 1561 critically ill COVID-19 patients, 1014 were included in the baseline analysis. In the survival study, 1009 patients were assigned to the NoC (n = 346), HighC (n = 552), or LowC group (n = 111). The baseline characteristics were balanced between groups, except for age, BMI, APACHE II score, SOFA and SAPS II. While the 35-day survival did not show any differences, a landmark analysis of the patients surviving beyond 35 days revealed differences between groups. The restricted mean survival time was 112 days in the LowC group [95% CI: 97 - 128], 133 days in the HighC group [95% CI: 124 - 141] and 144 days in the NoC group [95% CI: 121 - 167]. The multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard analysis indicated that, regardless of age, sex, health status or invasive oxygenation, a low-dose treatment increased the hazard of death of critically ill COVID-19 patients by a factor of 2.09 ([95% CI: 0.99, 4.4], p = 0.05) and a high-dose corticosteroid treatment increased the risk by a factor of 1.07 ([95% CI: 0.53, 2.15], p = 0.85) compared to no treatment with glucocorticoids. The analysis reveals that corticosteroid treatment does not influence the survival of critically ill COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit within 35 days. Our evaluations further suggest that regardless of ventilation status, the decision-making process for administering corticosteroid therapy should account for the individual severity of the illness.\",\n          \"High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) removes cholesterol, an essential component in lipid rafts, and this cholesterol removal can regulate protein attachment to lipid rafts, modulating their functionality in the immune cell response. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can alter the lipid profile, there is little information on the role of HDL-c and other lipids in prognostic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Mexican population. This study aims to evaluate the predictive value of HDL-c and lipid profile on severity and survival of 102 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 first wave. Our findings, derived from univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models, highlighted age and hypertension as significant predictors of survival (HR = 1.04, p = 0.012; HR = 2.78, p = 0.027), while gender, diabetes, and obesity showed no significant impact. Triglycerides and HDL-c levels notably influenced mortality, with elevated triglycerides and lower HDL-c associated with higher mortality risk (p = 0.032). This study underscores the importance of lipid profiles alongside traditional risk factors in assessing COVID-19 risk and outcomes. It contributes to the understanding of COVID-19 patient management and emphasizes the need for further investigation into the role of dyslipidemia in influencing COVID-19 prognosis, potentially aiding in refined risk stratification and therapeutic strategies.\",\n          \"BACKGROUND: Generally, there is limited information on longitudinal trends and the interrelations between physical activity (PA), problematic gaming behavior (PGB), described as a dysfunctional pattern of videogame activities, and quality of life (QoL) based on data that include measurements from both pre- and postpandemic onset. This is also the case for university students. As society faced unprecedented restrictions during this period, these aspects may have developed unfavorably. OBJECTIVE: To examine PA, PGB, and QoL among Norwegian University students prior to and during the initial stages of the pandemic and assess their temporal interrelations. METHOD: The data are derived from the \\\"Students' Psychological Health Over Time\\\" study (SPOT). Linear mixed models were used to examine the development from January 2020 to November 2020 over three time points for the total sample and across gender. A traditional cross-lagged panel model analysis was used to estimate temporal associations. Age, gender, socioeconomic status, and partner status were included as covariates. FINDINGS: PA and QoL decreased linearly over time (Cohen's d = 0.12 and 0.35, respectively), while only male students reported a small reduction in PGB (Cohen's d = 0.03). PA levels decreased considerably more for male students than female students (Cohen's d = 0.17 and 0.09, respectively). There was a small reciprocal negative temporal association between PA and PGB (standardized beta = -0.04 and -0.05, respectively). All other temporal associations were not statistically significant in the adjusted analysis. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight gender-variant negative developments in PA and QoL and suggest a negative reciprocal interrelation between PA and PGB. The findings point to potential adverse health effects that should be taken into account when restrictive pandemic measures are considered.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"DOI\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10.1038/s41598-024-62670-3\",\n          \"10.1002/jmv.29710\",\n          \"10.1080/21505594.2024.2360130\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Haseeb MW, Toutounji M\",\n          \"Borgogna C, Ferrante D, Rosso G, Guglielmetti G, Lo Cigno I, Raviola S, Caneparo V, Quaglia M, Cantaluppi V, Gariglio M\",\n          \"Cao J, Huang Z, Zeng J, Liu J, Zuo W, Su Z, Chen Y, Yu W, Ye H\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
